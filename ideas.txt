    - great white shark
        "It is THE LARGEST predatory fish in the ocean\ntoday, and can grow up to roughly 20 feet long",
        "Their teeth can grow as long as 6.6 inches",
        "They can detect a single drop of blood\nin 25 gallons (nearly 100 liters) of water",
        "In waters around Australia, the fatality\nrate from a single bite was nearly 60%",
        "Their blood is so highly toxic (extreme levels\nof mercury and arsenic) that almost\nno other animal would be able to tolerate it",
        "Orcas (killer whales) are one of their only predators",
        "As dangerous as they are, there have only been 354\nunprovoked attacks on humans, resulting in 57 fatalities",
        "They often detect their prey, not by sight or\nsmell, but by sensing the electric field\nof prey through pores on their snout"

    - box jellyfish
        "Not only can they see, but they have up to\n24 eyes, each contributing to distinct\nfunctions of vision (seeing colour, light and dark etc.)",
        "It is quite rare for them to live for longer than 9 months to a year",
        "A single sting can cause humans extreme pain, cardiac\narrest, paralysis, or even death, within 5 minutes",
        "Common prey include fish, worms, shrimp, and other crustaceans",
        "Common predators include sharks and leatherback sea turtles",
        "Commonly found in warm waters in the Indian and\nPacific oceans, between Thailand and the Phillipines\nand off the Northern coast of Australia",
        "Unlike most jellyfish, they can actually swim, they arent just carried by ocean currents",
        "Their tentacles can be up to 10 feet in length"

2. twilight zone
    - sperm whale
        "They are the largest toothed whale, weighing up to 50 tons",
        "Their head makes up 1/3rd of their length,\ncarrying the largest brain of any animal on Earth",
        "They consume up to 2 tons of food DAILY",
        "They can hold their breaths for up to 90 minutes,\nand dive deeper than 3000ft looking for prey!",
        "Females often adopt offsprings that aren't their own and raise them",
        "They nap for 10-15 minutes at a time\nseveral times a day, in groups, VERTICALLY",
        "They communicate with each other using clicks (called\ncodas), each with a distinct purpose",
        "Their diet consists mainly of octopi and squid"

3. midnight zone 
    - anglerfish
        'Females have the "Esca", a glowing lure, on their heads to attract prey in the ocean depths',
        "After a certain point in their lives, the males have to fuse to the females permanently, using the females for nutrition like a parasite",
        "Their stomachs can expand enough to allow them to swallow prey twice their size",
        "They have very slow metabolism, allowing them to go months without eating",
        "Unlike most predators, they don't chew. Instead, they swallow prey whole",
        "Some species can control the brightness of their Esca",
        "Because they hunt in total darkness, they can detect prey by the electric fields they produce"

4. abyssal zone 
    - goblin shark
        "Because they live in the depths of the ocean, they locate their prey using electroreceptors in their nose",
        "They can live for up to 60 years",
        "They live at depths of 4000+ feet",
        "They have 30-50 rows of near-transparent teeth. They cannot even fit them all in their mouth",
        "They possess a long, flattened snout (the "Rostrum"), which can be over 1ft long".

        "They can live up to EIGHTY years!",
        "At lengths of up to 6m, they are one of the largest sharks in the ocean today",
        "They have previously been filmed attacking submarines",
        "They are believed to be among the most prehistoric of sharks. Some of their characteristics are unchanged since 200 million years ago",
        "They can be found up to depths of 6000ft!"
